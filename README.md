Instructions:
1. Make sure you have the latest version of pytest installed on your machine
	open your terminal
	type 'pip install pytest
		if you are using anaconda use 'conda install pytest'
	If you have any questions you can read this documentation -> https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/getting-started.html#get-started
2. Click the Grade Button
3. Click the assignment you wish to grade
	this will open the test file in your default text editor
4. Remove the function from the bottom that runs the program
	for example 'main()' would need to be removed for pytest to work properly
5. Click autograde for the assignment
6. Read the rubric and grade depending on what tests passed/failed

Note:
Keep all files in the same folder with the name 'autograder' in order for it to work!
